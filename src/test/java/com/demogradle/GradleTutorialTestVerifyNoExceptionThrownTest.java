================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The 'System.out.println' statement is a debug statement left in the production code. This may lead to information leakage which can be exploited by an attacker to gain more knowledge about the system.
Solution: All debug code and comments should be removed from the production code. Use a logging framework with different levels of severity and only log necessary information.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The function 'GradleTutorial.main' might throw an exception which will be printed to the console. If the exception contains sensitive information, this could lead to an information disclosure.
Solution: Catch the exception and handle it properly. Do not reveal any sensitive information in the error messages.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify No Exception Thrown Test

Details:  
  TestName: verifyNoExceptionThrownMethod.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the verifyNoExceptionThrown method executes without throwing any exceptions. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No data or mocks are required for this test as the method does not take any parameters or dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the verifyNoExceptionThrown method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that no exceptions were thrown during the execution of the method.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method executes without throwing any exceptions. This is expected as the method only prints a string and calls the main method of the GradleTutorial class with an empty string array. The test is significant as it ensures that the method's functionality is correct and does not cause any unexpected errors or exceptions.


Scenario 2: Verify Output Test

Details:  
  TestName: verifyOutputOfMethod.
  Description: This test checks if the verifyNoExceptionThrown method correctly prints "Hello There!" to the console.
Execution:
  Arrange: Capture the console output using a PrintStream.
  Act: Invoke the verifyNoExceptionThrown method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the captured console output with the expected output.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly prints "Hello There!" to the console. This is expected as it is the hardcoded string that the method is supposed to print. This test is significant as it ensures that the method's output is as expected.


Scenario 3: Verify Main Method Call Test

Details:  
  TestName: verifyMainMethodCall.
  Description: This test checks if the verifyNoExceptionThrown method correctly calls the main method of the GradleTutorial class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the GradleTutorial class and its main method.
  Act: Invoke the verifyNoExceptionThrown method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the main method of the GradleTutorial class was called with an empty string array.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calls the main method of the GradleTutorial class with an empty string array. This is expected as it is the hardcoded behavior of the method. This test is significant as it ensures that the method correctly interacts with other parts of the system.
